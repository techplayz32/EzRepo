# EzRepo ![GitHub Downloads (all assets, all releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/techplayz32/EzRepo/total)
EzRepo - a quick way to download repositories by URL, without needing to open a browser.

## How to Install
You can install the .exe file or the source code with .py files from the latest stable release.
If you prefer not to install libraries, you can download the .exe file from the latest stable release.

### Installing Requirements (skip this section if you installed the .exe file)
Open your terminal in the directory where you installed EzRepo and launch `installRequirements.py` by executing this command in the terminal:
```
python installRequirements.py
```
The installer will detect your current OS and install the necessary libraries for your system.

## Usage
Launch the .exe file, or if you installed the .py files, open your terminal and launch `builder.py` by executing this command in the terminal:
```
python builder.py
```
After launching, you will see the GUI on your screen (you can ignore the terminal, as it will only display logs).
